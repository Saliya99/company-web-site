            SFA is a sophisticated tool for sales managers: something that
            become your right hand. It automates many of the routine tasks
            required of managers such as updating spreadsheets, counting sales
            visits and tallying last-minute Friday night reports. The data is
            recorded in real-time to a cloud by the SFA. Managers download a
            weekly report straight to their email. The real-time nature of the
            data entry also improves a sales managerâ€™s tactical decision-making
            skills. As a routine practice, sales people upload data into their
            CRM at the end of the week when the majority of the information is
            either forgotten or left incomplete. Managers are left with just a
            partial overview of which clients were visited, deal status, sales
            cycle progression, etc. Smart Salesman becomes handy with accurate,
            real-time sales data managers can identify which territories need
            more coverage, bottlenecks in the sales pipeline.
